# The (n, n, k)-game : A generalization of Tic-Tac-Toe

The standard game of Tic-Tac-Toe is generalized by allowing to resize the square grid as well as adjusting the streak of symbols required to end the game.

In this application, a user can play against an AI of varying difficulty, depending only on the allowed depth of the position search tree traversed in the Minimax Algorithm implemented with Alpha-Beta pruning.

### The Minimax Algorithm

In a nutshell, it is a decision rule for minimizing the maximum possible loss, or equivalently, maximizing the minimum possible gain. A very interesting demonstration is provided in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI).

### Working Example

This application is hosted on Google App Engine and is accessible at [link](https://n-n-k-game.uc.r.appspot.com/).
